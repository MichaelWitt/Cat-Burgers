# Cat-Burgers

Welcome to Cat Burgers! Come enjoy the best burger in town. Cats are welcome :)

## Project Details

Welcome to Cat Burgers!

Ready to place your order? This full-stack application will let you buy burgers, eat them, share them with friends, and delete them. It was created using a MySql database, Heroku, JawsDB, Express Server, JavaScript and other modern technologies. The database is connected with MySql and JawsDB so that customers can view past and present burgers ordered and eaten. Orders are displayed live on the server for your viewing and taste bud satisfaction.

Thanks for stopping in! I look forward to working together to make the present and future a better place.
